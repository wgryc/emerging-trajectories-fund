# Emerging Trajectories Fund

[Emerging Trajectories](https://emergingtrajectories.com/) uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate geopolitical and economic forecasts. We use the forecasts and knowledge bases to drive our trading strategy.

We'll be cleaning up this document in the coming weeks and months, but wanted to log our first trades and sources thereof. We'll also turn this into a bit of an 'index' approach for tracking purposes. Bear with us.
